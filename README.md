This project focuses on automated waste classification based on German waste sorting, using YOLOv11-based computer vision combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) to open the trash can automatically. By combining this with IoT hardware, it's possible to build smart trash can that identify the type of waste and automatically open the correct compartment. The goal is to support smart waste management and recycling in real time.
This project applies deep learning–based object detection techniques to classify waste categories such as plastic, paper, bio-waste, and others in real time, while integrating IoT systems to enable automatic smart trash can systems.
